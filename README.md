When we think of a feedback loop, we often imagine a system feeding its previous state into the next, an automatic cycle of cause and effect. In this project, we intervene manually and consciously in that loop. Each new iteration is not passively generated but actively constructed in response to an evolving ecology of internal and external telemetry.

This is a cybernetic process: the output of the system becomes input for the next state. Each step re-evaluates the prior, allowing for adaptation, mutation, and sometimes re-alignment. The feedback here is not only code-based but perceptual and interpretive, guided by observation and choice.

Each visualization is a reflection of the prior one, not just in its visuals but in its logic. Each commit in the version history is a deliberate mutation, forcing a re-evaluation of all previous states.
